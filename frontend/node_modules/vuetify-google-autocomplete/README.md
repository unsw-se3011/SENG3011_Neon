## Thanks

Huge thanks and credit goes to [@olefirenko](https://github.com/olefirenko) and contributors for creating [Vue Google Autocomplete](https://github.com/olefirenko/vue-google-autocomplete) from which this Vuetify ready version was inspired.

## Demo

Live Interactive demo: [madimetjashika.github.io/vuetify-google-autocomplete](https://madimetjashika.github.io/vuetify-google-autocomplete/)

## Installation

The easiest way to use Vuetify Google Autocomplete is to install it from **npm** or **yarn**.

```sh
npm i vuetify-google-autocomplete
```

Or

```sh
yarn add vuetify-google-autocomplete
```

### For version >= 2.0.0-alpha.2

Within your main.js or Vue entry point, import and initialise the component.

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue';
import VuetifyGoogleAutocomplete from 'vuetify-google-autocomplete';

Vue.use(VuetifyGoogleAutocomplete, {
  apiKey: '...', // Can also be an object. E.g, for Google Maps Premium API, pass `{ client: <YOUR-CLIENT-ID> }`
  version: '...', // Optional
});
```

### For version <= 1.1.0

This component uses Google Maps Places API to get geo suggests for autocompletion, so you have to include the Google Maps Places API in the `<head>` of your HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
    …
    <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&libraries=places"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    …
  </body>
</html>
```

To obtain API key please visit the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com). The API's that you have to enable in your Google API Manager Dashboard are [Google Maps Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start), [Google Places API Web Service](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/) and [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/).

## Usage and API

### For version >= 2.0.0-alpha.1

Simply start using the component in your HTML.

```html
<vuetify-google-autocomplete
    id="map"
    append-icon="search"
    disabled="true"
    placeholder="Start typing"
    v-on:placechanged="getAddressData"
>
</vuetify-google-autocomplete>
```

### For version <= 1.1.0

The Vuetify Google Autocomplete works out of the box by just including it.

```js
import VuetifyGoogleAutocomplete from 'vuetify-google-autocomplete'

```

In your template you can use this syntax:

```html
<vuetify-google-autocomplete
    id="map"
    append-icon="search"
    disabled="true"
    classname="form-control"
    placeholder="Start typing"
    v-on:placechanged="getAddressData"
>
</vuetify-google-autocomplete>
```

### Properties

**Please refer to the [Props API](https://madimetjashika.github.io/vuetify-google-autocomplete/docs/module-vuetify-google-autocomplete.props.html) or [JSDOCS.md file](https://github.com/MadimetjaShika/vuetify-google-autocomplete/blob/dev/JSDOCS.md) for a complete "living" definition of all props supported by this library.**

> NB: This componenent implements the same props as those specified for [Vuetify Text Fields](https://vuetifyjs.com/components/text-fields) as at v1.0.3. Please see [Vuetify Text Fields](https://vuetifyjs.com/components/text-fields) for a complete list of available props.

### Events
The component emits next events, which you can listen in your application:

#### placechanged
Gets triggered when the address data got obtained. This data is available on the returned objects:
* `street_number`, `route`, `locality`, `administrative_area_level_1`, `country`, `postal_code`, `latitude`, `longitude`.
* `place` - [PlaceResult object](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#PlaceResult) is available as second parameter.

#### no-results-found
Gets triggered when a user entered the name of a Place that was not suggested and pressed the Enter key, or the Place Details request failed.

#### focus
Gets triggered when the autocomplete input field receives focus.

#### blur
Gets triggered when the autocomplete input field loses focus.

#### inputChange
Gets triggered every time autocomplete input got changed

#### change
Gets triggered when the autocomplete results got changed

#### keypress
Gets triggered when a key gets pressed

### Exposed component functions

These functions are accessible by setting "ref" on the component ([Refs documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Child-Component-Refs)). See example below how to use these functions.

#### clear()

Call to clear the value of the user input.

#### focus()

Call focus to focus on the element

#### blur()

Call blur to blur (unfocus) the element

#### update(value)

Call to update the user input with a new value


### Example

Please note that you need to provide what method will listen (`v-on:placechanged`) to an event when the address data is obtained.

```html
<template>
    <div>
        <h2>Your Address</h2>
        <vuetify-google-autocomplete
            ref="address"
            id="map"
            classname="form-control"
            placeholder="Please type your address"
            v-on:placechanged="getAddressData"
            country="sg"
        >
        </vuetify-google-autocomplete>
    </div>
</template>

<script>
    export default {
        data: function () {
            return {
              address: ''
            }
        },
        mounted() {
            // To demonstrate functionality of exposed component functions
            // Here we make focus on the user input
            this.$refs.address.focus();
        },
        methods: {
            /**
            * When the location found
            * @param {Object} addressData Data of the found location
            * @param {Object} placeResultData PlaceResult object
            * @param {String} id Input container ID
            */
            getAddressData: function (addressData, placeResultData, id) {
                this.address = addressData;
            }
        }
    }
</script>
```
