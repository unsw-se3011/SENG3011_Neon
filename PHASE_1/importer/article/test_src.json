Entamoeba histolytica trophozoite/CDC/ Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) Aray said that in the last five days, about 380 people, mostly children, have presented with symptoms of amebiasis in Sotillo, Bolivar and Urbaneja municipalities. Many cases have been confirmed as amebiasis. \u201cWe believe that there is a common origin because the cases are appearing progressively in each of the municipalities, this may be attributable to the consumption of unfit water.\u201d said Aray. Amebiasis is a disease caused by the parasite Entamoeba histolytica. It can affect anyone, although it is more common in people who live in tropical areas with poor sanitary conditions. People mostly get infected with the parasite from ingestion of fecally contaminated food and water containing the amebic cysts. Vaccine-preventable diseases in Venezuela: A growing public health crisis that threatens the entire region According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only about 10% to 20% of people who are infected with E. histolytica become sick from the infection. Of those who do become sick, symptoms may include stomach pain, bloody stools (poop), and fever. Rarely, E. histolytica invades the liver and forms an abscess (a collection of pus). In a small number of instances, it has been shown to spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs or brain, but this is very uncommon.

The Legionnaires\u2019 outbreak happened at the California Health Care Facility (CHCF) in Stockton, California. CHCF delivers medical care to California\u2019s prison inmates with the most severe medical needs. This image depicts two Legionella pneumophila bacterial colonies (arrowheads), amongst other bacterial colonies grown on BCYE (Buffered Charcoal Yeast Extract) agar/CDC A post-death analysis revealed that the inmate who died tested positive for with Legionella bacteria. Legionnaires\u2019 disease is caused by Legionella bacteria. Legionella bacteria live in water. People can inhale Legionella bacteria in water vapor or water droplets. After the deceased inmate tested positive for Legionella bacteria, California corrections officials began systematically testing all patients with \u201cradiologically confirmed pneumonia\u201d for Legionella bacteria. Of the sixteen inmate patients tested, one additional inmate tested positive for Legionella. According to the California Health Care Facility : \u201cThe source of Legionella is still under investigation. In an abundance of caution, CHCF is providing bottled water for drinking and hygienic functions, halting the use of any aerosolizing equipment, shutting down the use of showers in specific areas and providing education to both staff and patients.\u201d According to the Los Angeles Times : \u201cThe last major Legionnaires\u2019 outbreak in California was in 2017 and centered on Disneyland; 22 people fell ill and one died. In that outbreak, state officials pointed to the amusement park\u2019s air-conditioning system, which carried high level of Legionella bacteria.\u201d Additional information on Legionnaires\u2019 disease for patients and clinicians is available from the CDC .",

Infographic aimed at college students depicting symptoms of mumps and steps they can take to protect themselves. From January 1 to February 28, 2019, 30 states and the District of Columbia in the U.S. reported mumps infections in 151 people to CDC. Mumps is a highly infectious disease passed through saliva and respiratory secretions. While the incubation period is 12 to 25 days, symptoms often appear 16 to 18 days after exposure. The symptoms for the mumps are similar to influenza (the flu) and often include tender swollen glands below the ear and along the jawline on one or both sides of the face and neck, headache, fever and cold-like symptoms. People with mumps are considered infectious from two days before swelling begins through five days after the start of swelling. Mumps can be prevented with MMR vaccine. This protects against three diseases: measles, mumps, and rubella. MMR vaccine is safe and effective. A person with two doses of MMR vaccine has about an 88% reduction in risk for mumps; a person with one dose has a 78% reduction in risk for mumps.",

This is a transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of Zika virus/ Cynthia Goldsmith The unpublished evidence, which suggests the need to investigate the relevance of these alternative routes of virus transmission was observed by Flavivirus of Molecular Biology Laboratory of the Instituto Oswaldo Cruz (IOC / Fiocruz). The studies were led by researcher Myrna Bonaldo, head of the Laboratory, in collaboration with the National Institute of Infectious Diseases Evandro Chagas (INI / Fiocruz). According to the statement, samples from two patients with the symptoms of Zika infection were analyzed. Aliquots of the samples were placed in contact with Vero cells, which are widely used in studies of viral activity in the case of the flavivirus family, which belong to the Zika virus, dengue and yellow fever, among others. Scientists have observed the cytopathic effect (CPE) of the cells, which indicate vial activity. The presence of the genetic material of zika virus was confirmed by RT-PCR in Real Time. It was also performed the partial sequencing of the virus genome. Laboratory diagnosis ruled out the presence of dengue virus and chikungunya \u2013 for these analyzes, we used the NAT Kit Discriminatory for Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika recently developed by Fiocruz. \u201cIt was known that the virus could be present in both urine and saliva. This is the first time we\u2019ve demonstrated that the virus is active, ie, with the potential to cause infection, which opens new paradigms for understanding the transmission routes of the Zika virus. That answers an important question, however, the understanding of the epidemiological relevance of these potential routes of infection further studies\u201d notes Myrna Bonaldo.",

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Inhaled antibiotics are standard of care for gram negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection in individuals living with CF. However, there are no approved inhaled treatment options for gram positive MRSA lung infection despite the increase in MRSA prevalence, now affecting approximately 26% of people with CF in the United States. Savara completes enrollment for AeroVanc, inhaled MRSA drug for cystic fibrosis, phase 2 trials \u201cPersistent MRSA infection is associated with increased use of intravenous antibiotics, increased hospitalizations, a faster decline of lung function, as well as shortened life expectancy. Based on the completed Phase II study, AeroVanc represents a promising opportunity to make significant advancement in the treatment of this debilitating infection,\u201d said Elliott Dasenbrook, MD, MHS, Assistant Professor of Medicine and Director of the Adult Cystic Fibrosis Program at Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.

To date in 2017, health officials have reported 10 cases, including one death. Vibrio vulnificus/CDC Three cases have been seen in Sumter County, while the following counties have reported one case each: Charlotte, Citrus, Duval, Lee, Orange, Pasco and Santa Rosa. The Orange County patient is the one fatality reported to date, according to DOH numbers. Last year, Florida reported 46 cases, including 10 deaths. Vibrio vulnificus can cause disease in those who eat contaminated seafood or have an open wound that is exposed to warm seawater containing the bacteria. Ingestion of Vibrio vulnificus can cause vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Vibrio vulnificus can also cause an infection of the skin when open wounds are exposed to warm seawater; these infections may lead to skin breakdown and ulcers. Healthy individuals typically develop a mild disease; however, Vibrio vulnificus infections can be a serious concern for people who have weakened immune systems, particularly those with chronic liver disease. The bacterium can invade the bloodstream, causing a severe and life-threatening illness with symptoms like fever, chills, decreased blood pressure (septic shock) and blistering skin lesions. Vibrio vulnificus bloodstream infections are fatal about 50 percent of the time. A recent study showed that people with these pre-existing medical conditions were 80 times more likely to develop Vibrio vulnificus bloodstream infections than healthy people.",

Items used by an infected person, such as cups or soft drink cans, can also be contaminated with the virus, which may spread to others if those items are shared. Symptoms typically appear 16-18 days after infection, but this period can range from 12-25 days after infection. It is usually a mild disease, but can occasionally cause serious complications. The most common complication is inflammation of the testicles (orchitis) in males who have reached puberty; rarely does this lead to fertility problems. Other rare complications include inflammation of the brain and/or tissue covering the brain and spinal cord(encephalitis/meningitis), inflammation of the ovaries (oophoritis) and/or breasts (mastitis) in females who have reached puberty and deafness. Anyone who is not immune from either previous mumps infection or from vaccination can get mumps. University Health Services is recommending that anyone showing symptoms of mumps not attend large social functions, such as the Blue-White Game on April 22, in an effort to stop further spread of the disease. According to preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2,305 mumps cases have been reported in the US this year through Apr. 8.

North Carolina map/ National Atlas of the United States Mumps is spread through indirect or direct contact with an infected person\u2019s nose or throat droplets (saliva or mucus), such as when an infected person coughs or sneezes.  People with mumps can spread it for up to two days before and five days after swelling develops. To prevent the spread of this virus, wash your hands frequently; don\u2019t share beverages, eating utensils or cigarettes; cover your cough and sneeze; and avoid close contact with ill individuals. Early symptoms are non-specific, and include muscle aches, lack of appetite, malaise, headache, and low-grade fever. Parotitis (swelling of the parotid glands) tends to occur within the first 2 days and may be first noted as earache and tenderness on palpation of the angle of the jaw.  Symptoms tend to decrease after 1 week.  The symptoms may start anywhere from 12-25 days after exposure. Persons who may have mumps infection must stay home for 5 days after the onset of swelling.  If you are vaccinated, your risk of infection is lower; however, it is important to be aware of the signs and symptoms because even fully vaccinated individuals can contract the disease. Mumps can occasionally cause complications, especially in adults.  Complications include inflammation of the testicles, brain, tissue covering the brain, ovaries, breasts and deafness.

The cases on the two islands are not related to each other and have separate travel histories, but all cases are unvaccinated young adults with recent travel either to the Philippines or Indonesia and Malaysia. \u201cMeasles is highly contagious, spreading through the air by breathing, coughing or sneezing, and infecting 90 percent of the contacts who are not immune\u201d said Dr. Sarah Y. Park, state epidemiologist. \u201cMeasles outbreaks continue to occur both internationally and on the mainland, especially in areas where vaccination is declining. As travel increases during the holiday season, so does our chance of seeing more cases.\u201d Since January, there have been 594 cases of measles reported in 22 states according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including two cases in Hawaii reported earlier this year in February. With the additional recently confirmed cases, Hawaii now has a total of five confirmed cases reported in the state this year. Measles or rubeola, is an acute highly communicable viral disease that is characterized by Koplik spots in the cheek or tongue very early in the disease. A couple of days later a red blotchy rash appears first on the face, and then spreads , lasting 4-7 days. Other symptoms include fever, cough and red watery eyes. The patient may be contagious from four days prior to the rash appearance to four days after rash appearance. The disease is more severe in infants and adults. Complications from measles which is reported in up to 20% of people infected include; seizures , pneumonia , deafness and encephalitis. For more infectious disease news and information , Vaccination is the best protection against measles .",

    "main_text": "The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals (DHH) confirmed 15 new cases of West Nile virus, of which five were neuroinvasive disease infections, bringing this year\u2019s total to 118 reported infections. There were no new deaths reported this week. This week\u2019s new infections include five neuroinvasive disease cases in Ascension (1), Bossier (1), East Baton Rouge Parish (1), Ouachita (1) and Pointe Coupee (1) parishes. There were nine new cases of West Nile fever; these cases were in Caddo (3), East Baton Rouge (5) and LaFourche (1) parishes, and one new asymptomatic case in East Baton Rouge (1) parish. \u201cDuring the fall, thousands of Louisiana residents head outside for athletic events, especially college football games. Before hitting the field or heading to a tailgate, we encourage residents to use mosquito repellent, and to wear long sleeves and pants,\u201d said DHH State Epidemiologist Dr. Raoult Ratard. \u201cThe best way to fight the bite is by being proactive. Keep mosquito repellent in your car or bag so that you have it with you when you need it most.\u201d West Nile virus is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) most commonly spread by infected mosquitoes. West Nile virus can cause febrile illness, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) or meningitis (inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord). It was first detected in North America in 1999, and has since spread across the continental United States and Canada. Most people get infected with West Nile virus by the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on infected birds. Infected mosquitoes can then spread the virus to humans and other animals. In a very small number of cases, West Nile virus has been spread through blood transfusions, organ transplants, and from mother to baby during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding, according to the CDC. As of September 23, in people, birds, or mosquitoes. Overall, 979 cases of West Nile virus disease in people have been reported to CDC. Of these, 544 (56%) were classified as neuroinvasive disease (such as meningitis or encephalitis) and 435 (44%) were classified as non-neuroinvasive disease.",

    "main_text": "A Salt Lake County resident has become the first human West Nile virus (WNV) case in Utah in 2014, according to a Fox 13 report today . The individual is an adult age 65 or older, according to the Utah Department of Health. The case was the milder West Nile fever and not the more serious neuroinvasive variety. Salt Lake County, Utah (in red)/David Benbennick \u201cAbout three weeks ago in Salt Lake County we started seeing West Nile Virus in our mosquitoes,\u201d Sam Dickson said, Manager of Salt Lake City Mosquito Abatement District. \u201cSince then, every week since we\u2019ve gotten more and more samples that have been positive to West Nile Virus.\u201d To date, Salt Lake County has accounted for nearly 50% of the WNV positive mosquito pools in the state (40/83). West Nile virus is transmitted through the bite of a mosquito that has picked up the virus by feeding on an infected bird. Common West Nile virus symptoms include fever, nausea, headache and muscle aches.Symptoms may last from a few days to a few weeks. However, four out of five people infected with West Nile virus will not show any symptoms. The best ways to avoid the West Nile Virus include the use mosquito repellents that contain DEET or picaridin when outdoors from dusk to dawn, wearing  long-sleeved shirts and long pants while outdoors, making sure window and door screens are in good repair to prevent mosquito entry and draining standing water around your house to reduce the number of mosquitoes (old tires, buckets, wading pools, etc.).",

    "main_text": "The number of pertussis cases in California has increased by an additional 760 cases since the last update two weeks ago, bringing the total number to 6,930 in 2014 to date. Boy with whooping cough/Video Screen Shot Nearly 200 pertussis patients required hospitalization for their illness, with about one-fifth of those patients in intensive care. Six out of 10 hospitalizations were in young infants <4 months old. Both Los Angeles and San Diego counties have reported in excess of 1,000 cases, with 1,303 and 1,140 cases respectively. Whooping cough is caused by the bacteria, Bordetella pertussis. This vaccine-preventable disease is spread through direct contact with respiratory discharges via the airborne route. Pertussis goes through a series of stages in the infected person; initially a irritating cough followed by repeated, violent coughing. The disease gets its nickname by coughing without inhaling air giving the characteristic high-pitched whoop. Certain populations may not have the typical whoop like infants and adults. It is highly communicable, especially in very early stages and the beginning of coughing episodes, for approximately the first 2 weeks. Then the communicability gradually decreases and at 3 weeks it is negligible, though the cough my last for months. Pertussis is an endemic disease found worldwide. In this country, according to the CDC, outbreaks occur every 3-5 years. Those that are not immunized are susceptible to this disease. Young infants and school aged children (who are frequently the source of infection for younger siblings) are at greatest risk.",

    "headline": "Lawsuit Filed After Arkansas Visitor Was Sickened By Shigella Tainted Food from Salsarita\u2019s Restaurant in Wal-Mart",
    "date_of_publication": "2014-07-29Txx:xx:xx",
    "main_text": "Attorneys Bill Marler and Drew Falkenstein of Marler Clark, the nation\u2019s only law firm dedicated to representing victims of foodborne illness, have filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Benton County, Arkansas on behalf of married couple Delida Groom and James Groom. Mrs. Groom was visiting the area when she was sickened with Shigellosis after consuming food from Salsarita\u2019s Restaurant located in the Wal-Mart Home Office Caf\u00e9 in Bentonville, Arkansas. Case number is CV 14-1029-1. In late June 2014, the Arkansas State Health Department announced that an outbreak of Shigella had occurred at the Wal-Mart Home Office in Bentonville, Arkansas. At or about the time of the announcement, Salsarita\u2019s restaurant had temporarily closed its doors. The health department has stated that 275 cases of Shigellosis have occurred in nine states as part of this outbreak. After investigation, health officials indicated that Salsarita\u2019s restaurant was the source of the outbreak. The outbreak stemmed from a few simple and preventable violations; some of which included employees not washing their hands and employees touching ready-to-eat food without wearing gloves. In June 2014, Mrs. Groom traveled to Bentonville, Arkansas to visit her parents. While in Arkansas, on Friday, June 13, 2014, she attended a luncheon that included multiple foods from the Wal-Mart Home Office Caf\u00e9, including chips, salsa, and other items produced at the Salsarita\u2019s restaurant located in the Caf\u00e9. The following evening, June 14, 2014, Mrs. Groom began to feel slightly fevered, light-headed, and nauseated. Over the next several days, her symptoms spiraled and included bloody diarrhea and severe gastrointestinal issues. She was later given treatment for metabolic disturbances given her immense gastrointestinal losses and hospitalized in the ICU for several days receiving critical care. Mrs. Groom developed long-term complications and continues to suffer from the effects of the Shigellosis illness. \u201cAfter thousands of cases, I am still amazed at how these outbreaks start,\u201d said Marler. \u201cWashing your hands and putting on gloves is not rocket science and it only takes a minute or two.\u201d Shigellosis is an infectious disease caused by a group of bacteria called Shigella. Most who are infected with Shigella develop diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps starting a day or two after they are exposed to the bacteria. The diarrhea is often bloody. Shigellosis usually resolves in 5 to 7 days. Persons with Shigellosis in the United States rarely require hospitalization. A severe infection with high fever may be associated with seizures in children less than 2 years old.",
