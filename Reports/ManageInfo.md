## Software Help Manage Team

<!-- Need to expand the details and how we will use it. -->

### GitHub/ Repo Project

Github is commonly use and be assigned as a repo manage platform by this course. Also the Project feature in the GitHub repo is a replacement of Trello. It's easy to use and we don't need to sign in to another website to manage the repository.

### WeChat

Since all of teamates are Chinese, we are using WeChat for all day. So the message in WeChat won't be missed by our teamates.

### Google Doc

Google Doc allow us to edit a same time. It's very suitable for us to work together about same documents and share the information about this project.

## Summary of Poject Management
Overall, we divided the entire project into several parts which are the frontend, backend, scraper, management, documentation, and data extraction. Also, we subdivided what we needed to do in each part, and set a time we expected to finish the task for each part. Meanwhile, the actual time taken to complete each part were constantly updated. Tasks for each member were distributed according to their personal strength in order to improve productivity. Each team member would first mark the their given tasks in yellow and then mark them in green after they completed the tasks. Although all the work we planned were carried out in the way we want, unfortunately due to time, some of our parts were not fully implemented as we expected. Besides, we used Wechat to communicate with each other since everyone of us have a Wechat account. Wechat made it faster and easier to communicate and make improvement for our project as well as acting the role as a online log book which records all the work we done everyday so that everyone of us were on the same page to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of our work.
