## Software Help Manage Team

<!-- Need to expand the details and how we will use it. -->

### GitHub/ Repo Project

Github is commonly use and be assigned as a repo manage platform by this course. Also the Project feature in the GitHub repo is a replacement of Trello. It's easy to use and we don't need to sign in to another website to manage the repository.

### WeChat

Since all of teamates are Chinese, we are using WeChat for all day. So the message in WeChat won't be missed by our teamates.

### Google Doc

Google Doc allow us to edit a same time. It's very suitable for us to work together about same documents and share the information about this project.
