# Design Detail

## API Module Development

### Design

Design details will be discuss in our group meetings, we will follow these steps:

1. Disscuss Overall Service Structure
2. Identify the iteration pattern between server and client
3. Collect all the information need to be included in endpoints
4. Design how to decouple the data

### Testing

We will try to do these to help us test our backend API:

- REST Client's interative API documents
- Develop our enpoint test cases by Django Unit Test
- Develop test cases for our internal method by using Django Unit Test
