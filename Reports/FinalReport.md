Natural Language Parser Engine by Nlpe <br>
Continuous runtime environemnt by docker



## Team organisation and conclusion/appraisal of your work  

- Responsibilities/organization of the team
  - Ruofei.Huang  <br>
 ----- ADD SOMETHING ------
  - Xinze.Song
  - Ziqing.Yan  
  Testing both backend and frontend also provide advices about the UI design and implenmentation. Report writing and documentation.
  - Huiyue.Zhang
- How did the project go in your opinion  
  - Major achievements in project  
    - Development of an usable, reliable API by ourself.
    - Extract major information from website by Scrapy
    - Using NLPE to process the data from Scrapy
    - Using Vue to develop a website in a short time period
    - Format the data from other group's API hence it can use in our website
    - Using Swagger to document our API
    - Using Docker, Docker-compose and Kubernetes to standardize our runtime envrionement

  - Issues/problems encountered
    - Some report's main text still have unexpected characters and format
    - Some report's title missing number of affected people or disease name which makes the title not make sense
    - Could not reponse to the user input in report detail page.
    - The dot chart could not be presented in the first time of visit until it refresh the page
    - Could not use 'Get started' button to access search page
    - API returns data even have no parameters provided
    - API did not provide useful error message when it receive incorrect parameter

  - What kind of skills you wish you had before the workshop
    - Python Scrapy
    - Basic database development and management
    - CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous delivery)
    - Data anlayze algorithm
    - Natrual languague data extraction

  - Would you do it any differently now ?
    - Pay more resource on Natural Language part
    - Scrape more data source at the begining
    - Develop more algorithm on anlayze our data
    - Thinking more way to express our data
    - More detailed documentation on our API
    - More edge case testing of our backend
    - Focus more on deliverable rather than development build steps
